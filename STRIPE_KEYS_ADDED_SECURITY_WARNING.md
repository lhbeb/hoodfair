## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING

### 🚨 YOUR STRIPE KEYS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED PUBLICLY! 🚨

**What this means:**
- Your **LIVE Stripe secret key** was shared in this conversation
- Anyone with access to this conversation can see your keys
- This is a **CRITICAL security risk**
- Malicious actors could potentially use your secret key

### 🔐 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

**You MUST rotate (revoke and replace) these keys immediately:**

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys

2. **Roll/Revoke the exposed keys**:
   - Click the "..." menu next to each key
   - Select "Roll key" or "Delete key"
   - This will invalidate the old keys

3. **Generate new keys**:
   - Create new publishable and secret keys
   - Copy the new keys

4. **Update `.env.local ` with new keys**:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_NEW_KEY_HERE
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_NEW_KEY_HERE
   ```

5. **Restart dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Why This is Critical:

- ✅ **Publishable key** (pk_live_...) - Less critical, meant for client-side
- 🚨 **SECRET key** (sk_live_...) - **EXTREMELY CRITICAL**, can:
  - Process refunds
  - Access customer data
  - Create charges
  - Modify your Stripe account
  - **Potentially steal money**

### Timeline:

- **Immediately**: Rotate keys (5 minutes)
- **Within 24 hours**: Review Stripe dashboard for suspicious activity
- **Going forward**: Never share secret keys anywhere

## 📋 Current Configuration

Your `.env.local ` file now contains:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51SqSvCBf3Y77Xr3GvOUqk2Fvz2OyUDlyoWUIctYHIJrWfaVp3BZ9pcGGuNkoWyrHNV1WSDfDc8zhmvI7ykOBHCkT00a99hAxcU
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=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
```

**⚠️ THESE KEYS MUST BE ROTATED IMMEDIATELY ⚠️**

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now):
1. ✅ Test Stripe checkout (should work now)
2. 🚨 **ROTATE STRIPE KEYS** (critical!)

### After Rotating Keys:
1. Update `.env.local ` with new keys
2. Restart dev server
3. Test checkout again with new keys
4. Monitor Stripe dashboard for any suspicious activity

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never share secret keys** - Not in conversations, emails, or code
2. **Use test keys in development** - Only use live keys in production
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Especially after exposure
4. **Use environment variables** - Never hardcode keys in code
5. **Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`** - Never commit to git
6. **Use separate keys per environment** - Dev, staging, production
7. **Enable Stripe webhooks security** - Verify webhook signatures
8. **Monitor Stripe dashboard** - Check for suspicious activity regularly
